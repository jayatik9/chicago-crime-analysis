Introduction


Purpose

Our aim for this ML project is to Predict the probablitiy of an Arrest (if a crime results in arrest) given various known factors related to time of day and location.

Prediction - We are trying to analyse Arrest based on the data analysis and modelling, if the arrest is true or false given the Beat , District, Domestic, Crime Hour, etc. We are also merging the crime data with the police data do that we can take police station ZIP location to predict the Arrest.
