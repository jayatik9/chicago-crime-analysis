## Introduction

Crime in Chicago has been tracked by the Chicago Police Department’s Bureau of Records since the beginning of the 20th century. The city’s overall crime rate, especially the violent crime rate, is substantially higher than the US average. Chicago was responsible for nearly half of 2016’s increase in homicides in the US, though national crime rates stayed near historic lows.As of 2017, Chicago’s homicide rate is significantly higher when compared to the larger American cities of New York and Los Angeles, but lower when compared to smaller American cities. The reason for the violence which is localized to some areas of the city, including change in police tactics or increase in gang rivalry, remain unclear.

## Purpose

Our aim for this ML project is to Predict the probablitiy of an Arrest (if a crime results in arrest) given various known factors related to time of day and location.

Prediction - We are trying to analyse Arrest based on the data analysis and modelling, if the arrest is true or false given the Beat , District, Domestic, Crime Hour, etc. We are also merging the crime data with the police data do that we can take police station ZIP location to predict the Arrest.

## About the dataset

This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2011 to present.
